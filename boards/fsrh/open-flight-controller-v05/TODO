firmware.prototype:
- change board ID

default.cmake:
- serial ports

nuttx defconfig:
- Build Setup -> Debug Options -> Enable Debug Features (should this option be activated?)
- System Type -> STM32 Peripheral Support (difference between OTG FS and OTG FS/HS)
- System Type -> STM32 Peripheral Support (check if PWR should stay activated)
- System Type -> Timer Configuration (check the pwm mode)
- System Type -> Timer Configuration (should one timer be activated for an ADC)
- Board Selection -> Custom Board Configuration (Custom board name?)
- Board Selection (Complete Board-Specific Options should all be changed mybe this depends on Select target board)

board.h:
- maybe surround include "stm32_sdmmc.h by an if defined (e.g.: board.h Intelliflight-Eclipse project)
- check HSE clock definition (should we also include the definition via an if else statement?)

- remove SPI5 + SPI6
- adjust other SPI + U(S)ART configs
- add PWM/timers
