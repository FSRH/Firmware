default.cmake: serial ports

nuttx defconfig: Build Setup -> Debug Options -> Enable Debug Features (should this option be activated?)
System Type -> STM32 Peripheral Support (difference between OTG FS and OTG FS/HS)
System Type -> STM32 Peripheral Support (check if PWR should stay activated)
System Type -> Timer Configuration (check the pwm mode)
System Type -> Timer Configuration (should one timer be activated for an ADC)

board.h:
- remove SPI5 + SPI6
- adjust other SPI + U(S)ART configs
- add PWM/timers
